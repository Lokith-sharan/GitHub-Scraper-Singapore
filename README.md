# GitHub Users in Singapore

- This project scrapes user data from GitHub for users located in Singapore with more than 100 followers.
- The most surprising finding was the diversity of repositories created by these users.
- I recommend developers engage with the local GitHub community to enhance collaboration.

## Explanation of Data Scraping
This project uses the GitHub API to gather user profiles and their repositories, processing the information using Python.

## Interesting Fact
I found that many users have a high number of repositories but vary in their activity levels.

## Recommendation
Developers should consider contributing to open-source projects in their area to build connections and enhance their portfolios.
